## Project Description
This project combined two interests of mine : movies and front-end development. Throughout the course we explored multiple movies and discussed their scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts like like cryonics, CRISPR, euthanasia, epidemics, zombie apocalypse, mind uploading, robots and emotions, life on mars, plant emotions, genetics and DNA modification etc. So for the project I chose the movie *Inception* directed by Christopher Nolan. This is because it illustrates the concept of dream manipulation and that is not something common in today's world. 

In this project, I assessed the realities of the concepts shown in the movie and differentiated between scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts using research articles, books and youtube videos.

## Challenges 

- Inception is a science-fiction heist film and extracting the scientific concepts was the most fun and challenging part. Finding supporting evidence was demanding work. The answers to questions about topics like dreaming, life and death are less scientific and more philosophical. So for I had to dig into research papers, books, and reliable YouTube videos to search about sleep, dreams, lucid dreaming, and brain activity using.


## Key Learnings from this Project 

- Through this project, I learned to create a full blog website using Wix. This helped me practice designing layouts, adding images, embedding videos, and organizing content in aesthetic layout.

- It was interesting to see that some parts of the movie like how dreams feel real, have some basis in actual sleep research. But ideas like building complex dream worlds together or using machines to enter someone's mind are still pure fiction and not possible with today's technology. In a nutshell, this project helped me understand how movies can spark curiosity about science, improved my skills in researching and gave me hands-on experience in creating a complete website.
