## Project Description
This project combined two interests of mine : movies and front-end development. Throughout the course we explored multiple movies and discussed their scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts like like cryonics, CRISPR, euthanasia, epidemics, zombie apocalypse, mind uploading, robots and emotions, life on mars, plant emotions, genetics and DNA modification etc. So for the project I chose the movie *Inception* directed by Christopher Nolan. This is because it illustrates the concept of dream manipulation and that is not something common in today's world. So through this project, I assessed the realities of the concepts shown in the movie and differentiated between scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts using research articles, books and youtube videos.
