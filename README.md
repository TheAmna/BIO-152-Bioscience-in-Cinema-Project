## Project Description
This project combined two interests of mine : movies and front-end development. Throughout the course we explored multiple movies and discussed their scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts like like cryonics, euthanasia, epidemics, zombie apocalypse, mind uploading, robots and emotions, life on mars, plant emotions, genetics and DNA modification etc. So for the project I chose the movie Inception directed by Christopher Nolan. This is because it illustrates the concept of dream manipulation and that is not something common in today's world. So through this project, I assessed the realities of the concepts shown in the movie and differentiated between scientific and pseudo-scientific concepts using research articles, books and youtube videos.
